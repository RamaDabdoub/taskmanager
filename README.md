I didn't notice the email until this morning because it was in the spam folder, so I couldn't complete all the tasks. I tried to finish them in one day. I used GetX state management and HMVC architecture, along with ListView.builder, Card, Container, and other basic widgets in Flutter. I didn't have enough time to complete all the design details correctly, and I only applied validation on the email input field. I faced difficulty with pagination as the API response was not in the format expected by the user model, and I didn't have enough time to troubleshoot further. I didn't work on unit tests previously, so I didn't implement them, but I aspire to learn them along with bloc state management. I tried my best to complete the tasks in one day, and I always strive for continuous improvement and learning. Thank you very much for your attention.
